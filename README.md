### What's This?

Experimental mini-extension for [WooCommerce Mix and Match Products](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/) that adds a button next to the add to cart button. Clicking this "Pick for me" button adds the container to the cart with a random selection of child products.
